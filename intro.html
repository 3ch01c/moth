    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to Capture The Flag, blah blah blah.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Is</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A hacking contest</li>
      <li>A chance to witness the nature of real cyber incident response</li>
      <li>An opportunity to show off your 1337 skillz</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>What This Is Not</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A LAN party</li>
      <li>A chance to talk up how great you think you are</li>
      <li>An opportunity to show off your sweet gaming rig</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <h3>Important Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The contest network is 10.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i>.  <b>Do
        not attack machines outside the contest network</b>.</li>
      <li>If the "outside network" requires you to plug into a different
        switch, do not connect any machine that has been on the contest
        network.</li>
      <li>Consider this network hostile: your machine may be
        compromised.</li>
      <li>We expect you to be disruptive within the framework of the
        game (malicious code, network scanning, social engineering,
        etc.).  Disruptive behavior outside the game will result in a
        public and humiliating ejection from the contest area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Less-Important Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If IRC is up, you should use it to communicate with the
        contest staff.  Staff will have operator status in #ctf.</li>
      <li>If you think something is wrong with the game, you are
        expected to demonstrate the problem and explain why you think
        it's a problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hints</h2>

    <p>
      If you are really stuck, you can ask for a hint.  It will cost you
      points, though.  For puzzles, you will lose Â¼ of the points for
      that puzzle <em>even if you never solve the puzzle</em>.  For
      other events, the staff member will decide how many points it will
      cost.  You can try to bribe us or otherwise fanagle information
      out of us, or other contestants.  <em>It's a hacking contest.</em>
    </p>
