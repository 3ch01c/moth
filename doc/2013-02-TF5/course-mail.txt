Subject: Tracer FIRE: Your Course Assignment (repeat email)

This is a repeat email of your course assignment.  Some people didn't
recieve their assignment on Monday.  This should not contain any new
information if you've already seen your course assignment.


Your course assignment is:

    COURSE

Your course instructor will contact with you with any additional details
about the course.

If your course assignment is "None", you are still eligible to
audit the Network Archaeology course: you get the full suite
of course videos, monitor access to the 16-hour Q/A session
in IRC, and use of the interactive lab software.  Details at
http://csr.lanl.gov/tf/netre-audit.html



If you didn't get the course you registered for, you either did not
meet LANL's definition of "US Government or Critical Infrastructure",
or classes were full by the time you registered.  Sorry.

If we have prior arrangement with you regarding classes, that still
stands, I'm just not a smart enough fairy to handle all the special
arrangements.  Please email Neale privately so he can make sure everybody
gets what they were promised.
