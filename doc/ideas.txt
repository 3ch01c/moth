Ideas for puzzles
=================
* Hide something in a .docx zip file
* Bootable image with FreeDOS, Linux, Inferno? HURD?
  * Bury puzzles in various weird locations within each OS
  * Maybe put some in the boot loader, too
  * Perhaps have some sort of network puzzle as well
* Network treasure hunt
  * DHCP option
  * Single TCP RST with token in payload
  * Multiple TCP RST with different payloads
* PXE boot some sort of points-gathering client
  * Init asks for a team hash, and starts awarding points
  * Broken startup scripts, when fixed award more points
  * Lots of remote exploits
