CTF Packages
============

Packages are squashfs files.  

A hypothetical package named pkgname.sfs will be mounted under
/srv/pkgname.  The following top-level files and directories are
significant:

* /www/         -  Will appear as http://host/pkgname/, CGI can be run
* /bin/         -  Will be added to $PATH
* /puzzles/     -  Will appear as a puzzle category (see "Puzzles" below)
* /answers.txt  -  Puzzle answers for category pkgname (see "Puzzles" below)


Puzzles
-------

To expose puzzles, place them in the /puzzles/ directory, like so:

    /puzzles/10/index.html
    /puzzles/20/index.html
    /puzzles/20/script.cgi
    /puzzles/30/index.html
    /puzzles/30/something.jpg
    /puzzles/40/index.html

where the second directory is the point value of the puzzle.  This means
that no two puzzles in a category can have the same point value.

Files will be served up from the web server, and CGI scripts will be
executed.

Store answers to your puzzles in /answers.txt.  Answers are one per
line, with the point value appearing first, followed by a space, then
the answer.  Answers are case sensitive.  You may have multiple answers
for each point value.
