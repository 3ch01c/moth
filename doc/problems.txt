* claim.cgi not exiting (maybe fixed?)
* tanks/designer.cgi: s/token/team hash/
* teams.txt: Come up with a better solution to creating this at boot

NMT
---
* Lots of files missing at startup: I really need a new-contest script
* Tanks aren't awarding points (hadn't added tokens to packages)
  * put tokencli in tanks package
  * all packages ought to work standalone
* scoreboard: 8 points (1,1,3,3) looks incorrectly proportioned, maybe
  table height competing with cell height?
* sequence 300; puzzler isn't taking the unicode character right


Physical
--------

* We should buy a longer VGA cable
* Tape!
