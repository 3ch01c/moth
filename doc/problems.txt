Bugs
====

* claim.cgi not exiting (maybe fixed?)
* We need some programs so that we never have to edit .db files
  directly.  I truncated tokens.db with > instead of >>.
* Get erin to edit net-re
* Tanks documentation referencing wrong CSS
* Sequence 300 continues to be a pain in the ass
* ctfd wget won't overwrite
* tanks/winners.awk needs +x
* tanks/winner.awk printing out address instead of path?  How did
  this ever work?
* tanksd: holy shit fix
  * wrong path
  * can't squirrel away scores
* All tanks fixes are in LABEL=VAR/fixes
* Pwnables are generating new tokens way too quickly
* chroot jail is worthless


Physical
--------

* We should buy a longer VGA cable
* Tape!



Possibly fixed
--------------
* sequence 300; puzzler isn't taking the unicode character right


Won't fix
---------
* tanks/designer.cgi: s/token/team hash/
  "Token" is a good generic term given what forftanks (standalone) does.
  If necessary, we can pipe the output of the cgi through sed.
