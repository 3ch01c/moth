* "net-re" dash tripping up category validation in puzzler
* scores not preserved in /var/lib/ctf, wtf?
* bletchley 150 no key
* claim.cgi not exiting
* someone managed to get a point in no category.  that broke the scoreboard.
* ha ha, guess what this does if points.log already exists:
    install -o root -m 0644 /dev/null /var/lib/ctf/points.log
* scoreboard: teams aren't properly filling columns (make td have size)
* sequence 700 no key
* steg 20 not m4ing key
* no "pointscli" binary
* steg 200 totally screwed up
* get LAUR for contest
