Bugs
====

* claim.cgi not exiting (maybe fixed?)
* We need some programs so that we never have to edit .db files
  directly.  I truncated tokens.db with > instead of >>.
* Get erin to edit net-re


Physical
--------

* We should buy a longer VGA cable
* Tape!



Possibly fixed
--------------
* sequence 300; puzzler isn't taking the unicode character right


Won't fix
---------
* tanks/designer.cgi: s/token/team hash/
  "Token" is a good generic term given what forftanks (standalone) does.
  If necessary, we can pipe the output of the cgi through sed.
