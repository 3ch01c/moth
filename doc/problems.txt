* claim.cgi not exiting (maybe fixed?)
* tanks/designer.cgi: s/token/team hash/
* teams.txt: Come up with a better solution to creating this at boot


NMT
---
* Lots of files missing at startup: I really need a new-contest script
* Tanks aren't awarding points (hadn't added tokens to packages)
  * put tokencli in tanks package
  * all packages ought to work standalone
* scoreboard: 8 points (1,1,3,3) looks incorrectly proportioned, maybe
  table height competing with cell height?
* sequence 300; puzzler isn't taking the unicode character right
* mcp/ngircd.conf: add "OperCanUseMode = yes" to Global section
* scoreboard: if a team doesn't exist it's still giving them a name
* forf manual: describe comments
* key.png (8x12): .tnih a ton si siht
* We need some programs so that we never have to edit .db files
  directly.  I truncated tokens.db with > instead of >>.


Physical
--------

* We should buy a longer VGA cable
* Tape!
