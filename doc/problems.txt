Bugs
====

* claim.cgi not exiting (maybe fixed?)
* tanks/designer.cgi: s/token/team hash/
* teams.txt: Come up with a better solution to creating this at boot


NMT
---
* Lots of files missing at startup: I really need a new-contest script
* Tanks aren't awarding points (hadn't added tokens to packages)
  * put tokencli in tanks package
  * all packages ought to work standalone
* scoreboard: 8 points (1,1,3,3) looks incorrectly proportioned, maybe
  table height competing with cell height?
* forf manual: describe comments
* We need some programs so that we never have to edit .db files
  directly.  I truncated tokens.db with > instead of >>.
* Get erin to edit net-re
* reject port 22 from outside of 10.0.0.0/16


Physical
--------

* We should buy a longer VGA cable
* Tape!



Possibly fixed
--------------
* sequence 300; puzzler isn't taking the unicode character right
