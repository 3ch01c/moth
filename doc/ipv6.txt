IPv6 in Dirtbags CTF
====================

The contest network uses IPs in the unique local address space
fd82:b410:3441::/48.  Each team gets a /64 internal subnet, with
their team number (generally the same as the switch port).

Each subnet's gateway is ::1.

Team 5, in switch port 5, on VLAN 5, gets fd82:b410:3441:5::/64.

Server network is fd84:b410:3441::/64 (AKA fd84:b410:3441:0::/64).  To
make things easier to type, use hosts in the /112.  The MCP server lives
at fd84:b410:3441::2.
