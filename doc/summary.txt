LANL Capture The Flag
=====================

The LANL CTF training and exercise is designed to train novice to expert
analysts in new techniques and tools.  Course material is in a tutorial
format, which is bundled into the exercise.  

The class portion proceeds as a lecture style, although participants are
encouraged to work at their own pace, soliciting assistance from
instructors during the lab sections of the lecture.  A Capture-The-Flag
style exercise follows the training as a mechanism to reinforce concepts
the participants have just learned, as well as introduce new concepts,
and to help participants learn how to deal with an actual security
incident.  In the exercise portion, participants form into teams which
compete against each other to gain points in a broad spectrum of
categories.

Event categories and training topics are easily customized to better
meet each site's requirements for training.
