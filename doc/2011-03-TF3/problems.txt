Problems with Sandia
--------------------

* Tighter integration of scoreboard
* Spell out *exactly* what they can and cannot do:
  * No posters with offensive text
  * No machines at tables
  * No grabbing our network while we're using it
  * Give them exact network configuration information (they thought I
    said /24, we needed /16)
* Specify where they get to project their scoreboard and what color
  scheme it needs to be, including max luminosity
* They need to let me know well in advance if they want any links,
  hosted files, or anything else in our game server
* Let Kevin know that we need everything planned out in advance and will
  stubbornly refuse to accommodate any last-minute changes
* We handled power and network pretty well this year, do that again



Other problems
--------------

* We must have 8-foot rounds.  We got 5-foot rounds this year.  Bring
  measuring tape and tell hotel immediately.
* Explain tokens even more clearly to vendors
* Have puzzles explain what format examples should be in
* TFTP tank submission
* Interfaces on pwnables are going down
* Specify how vendors can participate on IRC with ads
* Provide schedule to hotel well in advance
* Fewer categories.  20 is too many.
* Tanks unmatched comment
* Auto-refreshing tanks page
* Text announcement system in scoreboard
* No text to speech announcements, or at least display text as it's
  being pronounced
* Have some 4" gaffer tape
* Classes need to start at the same time every day, danny thinks 9-4:30
* Go back to five days
* Have vendors sponsor a social event
* Pen testing class
* ltraceme needs to die


Bullshit
--------

* Chash wants a $800 chair
* Open bar
* Chash wants a Segway
* Chash wants a trash can behind the uh the thing.  And a terlet.
* Nerf weaponry
