<td><!-- contest-lanl -->None forensics puzzles needed to be replaced.  Answers needed verificaion and format specified.<br></td>
<td><!-- contest-sandia -->None Limiting it to 1 thing being worked on at a time for the group was a bad design.  Loosing points as others attempt to work on other pieces.</td>
<td><!-- contest-vendors -->★★ Finding your way through solera would be easier if it was commonly used.  Attempting to find what they anted through a gui is much more difficult that what I normally do vai dumping pcap.</td>
<td><!-- hotel -->★★ A strange but interesting place.  needed increaed water pressure if you want a hot shower.</td>
<td>With the forensics puzzles, having the same for the classroom vs the contest helped those that took close notes.  There is way too much use of Encase and limits on how far yoyu can get if you are unfamiliar with it.  </td></tr>

<td><!-- instructor -->★★ The portions of the instruction that were lecture only could have been improved by having students follow along and actually participate.  For example, instead of teaching Windows Registry purely by lecture, have students open Regex or examine the Registry using EnCase.</td>
<td><!-- classroom -->★★★ Good facilities and connections.  No complaints.</td>
<td><!-- class-content -->★★★ Aside from the pure lecture portions, the content was good.  Exactly what I expected when signing up for a forensics course.  Good that not a lot of time was devoted to teaching the basics of the programs, like EnCase.</td>
<td><!-- contest-setup -->★★★ Good facilities and connections.  No complaints.</td>
<td><!-- contest-ambiance -->★★ Would it kill you to play a little Smokey Robinson?  ;)</td>
<td><!-- contest-network -->★★★ No complaints.</td>
<td><!-- contest-lanl -->★★★ Awesome puzzles and contests.  So much to keep everyone busy.  Maybe a little too much material for smaller teams to even make a dent in scoring points.  My only complaint is the way in which answers are required to be formatted.  See the General Comments section for more detail.</td>
<td><!-- contest-sandia -->★★ I didn't really participate much in the Sandia Jeopardy business.  From what I saw, it looked good.</td>
<td><!-- contest-vendors -->★★★ Good way to show off their products without it being just a sales pitch.  The puzzles they provided were great.</td>
<td><!-- hotel -->★★★ Nice.  No complaints.</td>
<td>Participants should not have to decipher the format of the answer for the questions on their own.  Dates/times entries either need to be in a precise, specified format or the system should be able to taken input and determine whether or not the correct answer is known.  Whether or not an answer is correct should be determined by upper or lower case letters.  The scoring systems should be able to compare the data submitted and normalize the input and compare it to the correct answer.</td></tr>

<td><!-- hotel -->★★★ the laFonda was pretty awesome actually</td>
<td>I hope eI get to keep coming to these, this has been a great culmination of the first few years of my experience as a cyber analyst and it was great to see that I am indeed actually learning something.</td></tr>

<td>This is really great material and the puzzles are very well presented. The entire exercise is extremely well organized. 

This lacking was my background knowledge. 

Next time I am going to be a lot more prepared for the challenges. 

This was my first ever Capture the flag and participation in a exercise like this but you certainly have found a permanent participant. 

A+++++ will do it again.

<td><!-- contest-vendors -->None </td>
<td><!-- hotel -->None </td>
<td>The contest material was really good, but nobody on my team knew how to approach (or even find!) most of it. Maybe this would be fixed by better team distribution, but it would be likely that someone skilled would just take over, instead of teaching other people. Thus, I ended up feeling really frustrated that I wasn't actually learning anything, and just feeling punished for the things I didn't know or couldn't do (which was most of the contest).</td></tr>

<td>I think Tracer should foster more "forced" interaction--the idea of information sharing is key...beyond the event, within our real jobs. I would like better or just more classroom hours. Maybe a full week of class room and a weekend of challenges would be cool. thanks for all the hard work!</td></tr>
