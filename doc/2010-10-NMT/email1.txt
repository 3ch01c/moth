Are you ready for CTF?

The teams are in and it looks like this year's CTF is going to be about
double the size of last year.  I've posted teams at
<http://dirtbags.net/ctf>.

If you came last year, there are some changes in store for you.  I've
done away with the weird boxes at each table, so there's no need to
bring a monitor or keyboard.  What you really need to be a sysadmin this
year is netcat and nmap.  We will *not* provide an Internet connection,
so figure out now how you're going to get onto the Internet (you will
need it).

If you have any questions, or would just like to hang out and shoot the
breeze, feel free to hop on IRC (server woozle.org, channel #ctf).

I hope you all have as much fun playing this as I've had building it!
