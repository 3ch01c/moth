CTF starts TOMORROW!  Do you have sufficient stores of Mountain Dew?

This is CMU's first ever CTF, so please be ready for a couple of
hiccups.  Likewise, we expect you to be totally lost for a while, as you
get your bearings.  While we tried to cover everything in the
registration web page, here are some points worth repeating:

Your machine really ought to have netcat and nmap, and whatever
programming language(s) you prefer.  An Ubuntu live CD has, at past
contests, not been sufficient.  It's also a good idea to make sure your
computer works before you show up.  Time is precious, don't spend yours
installing an operating system.

We will have a switch at each table with gobs of ports, but you should
bring your own network cable.  We will *not* provide an Internet
connection, so figure out now how you're going to get onto the Internet
(you will need it).

If you have any questions, or would just like to hang out and shoot the
breeze, feel free to hop on IRC (server woozle.org, channel #ctf).

We hope you have as much fun playing this as we're going to have
watching you work!
