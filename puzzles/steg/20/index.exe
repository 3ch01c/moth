Molotov Cocktails
=================

There are many variations of the molotov cocktail. The classic is a
glass bottle filled with gasoline. An oily soaked rag is placed in the
neck of the bottle. The rag is lit on fire and the bottle is thrown at
the opposition. However, practice has created new models of the molotov
that defeat the classic version.

When making molotovs, it is never a good idea to use the oily rag
method. It can allow gas to seep from the bottle and many other bad
things. The best way is to take a tampon that is soaked in gas and place
it on the side of the bottle neck. Then, tie a rubber band around the
tampon. Make sure the bottle has a cap on it. Light the tampon and throw
hard. With this ignition method, the bottle must break!

When making a molotov mixture, one of the easiest mixtures is filling
half the bottle with gasoline, and the other half of the bottle with
motor oil. Mix well! The oil is very flammable and sticks very well to
the surface that it lands on.

Another mixture is to fill half the bottle with gasoline and the other
half with tar. This mixture burns very very hot and also sticks well to
surfaces while the gasoline does the work.

To make a firewall, simply fill bottles with rubbing alcohol and light
the mixture. These bottles should be lined up side by side to create a
large area of fire that police will not walk through.

By far the stickiest mixture is 50% gasoline, with 25% tar and 25%
grease. Shake well and throw hard!

The most high explosive and lethal mixture is amonium-nitrate-based
fertilizer mixed with gasoline. Just stuff the bottle with this mixture
and light the sucker. This method should be made with a plastic bottle
so that it will not break on impact. When you light it, the bottle will
quickly explode so be quick. Using a fuse is a good idea. 

'$key' is the key.
