<BODY>The FBI has asked for your team's assistance in conducting a forensic analysis of a seized hacker's drive.
The FBI tells you that the suspect is a known terrorist and may be using encryption on his disk.
They have put their best agent on the job, but he has been unsuccessful in mounting and analyzing the drive on
their forensic tool. Where do you tell Special Agent Dumas to begin looking to determine what type of filesystem
is being used and whether disk encryption may be employed?
