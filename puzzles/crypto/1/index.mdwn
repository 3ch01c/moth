<dd>Welcome to Crypto.  It works like this:  I'll say something to Bob,
and he'll say something back.  Our communication will be encrypted in some
manner, or at least obfuscated.  Your job is to get the plaintext, and 
find the puzzle key.
<dt>Bob
<dd>Sometimes the plaintext from one puzzle will give you a hint (or the 
cryptogaphic key) for the next.  When we give you such keys, we'll always 
do so in a straightforward manner.  The puzzle key for each puzzle
is always in what I say, and there shouldn't be any tricks involved in
figuring out what it is. 
<dt>Alice<dd>Good Luck!
<dt>Bob<dd>You'll need it.  By the way, the key is 'dirtbags'.
