    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to Capture The Flag.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Is</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A hacking contest</li>
      <li>A chance to experience the nature of cyber incident response</li>
      <li>An environment to safely experiment with offensive techniques</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>What This Is Not</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>An arena for purely malicious attacks</li>
      <li>A rave</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <h3>Important Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The contest network is 10.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i>.  <b>Do
        not attack machines outside the contest network</b>.  All
        federal, state, and school laws still apply to the outside
        network.</li>
      <li>If the "outside network" requires you to plug into a different
        switch, do not connect any machine that has been on the contest
        network.</li>
      <li>Consider this network hostile: your machine may be
        compromised.</li>
      <li>We expect you to be disruptive within the framework of the
        game (malicious code, network scanning, social engineering,
        etc.).  Disruptive behavior outside the game will result in a
        public and humiliating ejection from the contest area.</li>
      <li>No ARP attacks.  While cute, they are not particularly clever
        given our network topology, and would require expensive and
        bulky equipment to prevent.  Find something else to do.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Less-Important Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If IRC is up, you should use it to communicate with the
        contest staff.  Staff will have operator status in #ctf.</li>
      <li>If you think something is wrong with the game, you are
        expected to demonstrate the problem and explain what you think
        is the correct behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>

    <p>
      The contest is made up of multiple <em>categories</em>.  Each
      category is worth one point toward the total score; the percentage
      of the total points held by your team is the percentage of one
      point your team has for that category.  The team that has 30% of
      the points in each of five categories has 1.5 points, whereas the
      team that has 80% of the points in only one category has 0.8
      points.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two kinds of categories: <em>flags</em>
      and <em>puzzles</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Flags</h3>

    <p>
      Flag categories are challenges with a notion of a <em>winner</em>
      or <em>service availability</em>.  In these categories, the
      flag-holder (the winner, or each team with a running service)
      makes 1 point per minute for as long as they hold the flag.  If
      there is a single flag-holder, and the flag changes hands, a point
      is awarded to the new winner at the moment the flag moves.
    </p>

    <h3>Puzzles</h3>

    <p>
      Most of the categories come in the form of
      multiple <em>puzzles</em>: for each puzzle presented, a key
      (answer) must be found to recieve the amount of points that puzzle
      is worth.  Any team may answer any puzzle question at any time.  A
      new puzzle is revealed when a team correctly answers the
      highest-valued puzzle in that category.
    </p>

    <h2>Hints</h2>

    <p>
      If you are really stuck, you can ask for a hint.  It will cost you
      points, though.  For puzzles, you will lose Â¼ of the points for
      that puzzle <em>even if you never solve the puzzle</em>.  For
      other events, the staff member will decide how many points it will
      cost.  You can try to bribe or otherwise fanagle information out
      of us or other contestants.  <em>It's a hacking contest.</em>
