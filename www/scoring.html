    <h1>About scoring</h1>
    <p>
      The contest is made up of multiple categories.  Each category is
      worth one point toward the total score; the percentage of the
      total points held by your team is the percentage of one point your
      team has for that category.  The team that has 30% of the points
      in each of five categories has 1.5 points, whereas the team that
      has 80% of the points in only one category has 0.8 points.  It is
      typically better to have a few points in many categories, than
      many points in a few categories.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two main ways to make points: <em>puzzles</em>
      and <em>tokens</em>.  Your contest may have other ways to make
      points: these will either be automatic, or explained elsewhere.
    </p>


    <h2>Puzzles</h2>
    <p>
      Many of the categories are in the form of
      multiple <em>puzzles</em>: for each puzzle presented, a
      case-sensitive answer must be found to recieve the amount of
      points that puzzle is worth.  Any team may answer any puzzle
      question at any time.  A new puzzle is revealed when a team
      correctly answers the highest-valued puzzle in that category.
    </p>


    <h2>Tokens</h2>
    <p>
      Tokens are strings redeemable once for a single point each.  A
      token for the "example" category might look like this:
    </p>

    <pre>example:xenon-codex</pre>

    <p>
      Tokens are typically associated with "live" categories, such as a
      network-based service or a treasure hunt.  Tokens can be submitted
      with the form on the <a href="index.html">welcome page</a>, or you
      can write your own script to automate token submission.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some tokens change periodically, typically once a minute.  If you
      find a token, it's worth looking in the same place again later to
      see if the token changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Reading the scoreboard</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="scoreboard.html">scoreboard</a> shows total score on
      the left, and scores within each category.  If you have a smaller
      or more novice team, you may wish to ignore total rankings and
      strive to do well within only a few categories.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your browser supports the HTML5 canvas (Firefox, Safari,
      Chrome, Opera, iPhone, Android) and JavaScript, the scoreboard
      will also have a graph of scores over time.  Additionally,
      JavaScript-enabled browsers will highlight all point blocks
      belonging to a team, and a team's line on the graph, when the
      mouse cursor is over a point block.
    </p>


    <h2>About time</h2>
    <p>
      Many Capture The Flag contests attempt to reward teams who answer
      quickly with more points, by adding a "quick answer" bonus or
      decaying point values over time.  Our contest doesn't work this
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that given enough things to work on, quick-moving teams
      will emerge with more points by answering more questions; while
      providing novice teams a realistic picture of how they're doing.
      In addition, when the game infrastructure goes down—which seems to
      happen a lot in anybody's CTF—there's no losing points while the
      organizers struggle to get things back up.
