    <h1>About scoring</h1>
    <p>
      The contest is made up of multiple categories.  Each category is
      worth one point toward the total score; the percentage of the
      total points held by your team is the percentage of one point your
      team has for that category.
    </p>

    <p>
      Categories are in the form of
      multiple <em>puzzles</em>: for each puzzle presented, a
      case-sensitive answer must be found to receive the amount of
      points that puzzle is worth.  Any team may answer any puzzle
      question at any time.  A new puzzle is revealed when a team
      correctly answers the highest-valued puzzle in that category.
    </p>


    <h2>About time</h2>
    <p>
      Many Capture The Flag contests attempt to reward teams who answer
      quickly, by adding a "quick answer" bonus or by decaying point
      values over time.  Our contest doesn't work this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to focus on rewarding technical proficiency, allowing
      skilled contestants to prove their worth independent of their
      ability to hit F5 quickly.  It is our hope that by providing
      enough things to work on, quick-moving teams will emerge with more
      points by solving lots of puzzles, while novice teams get a solid
      benchmark against which to judge their technical skill level: you
      don't have to make allowances for reaction time in comparing
      scores.  In addition, when the game infrastructure goes down—which
      seems to happen a lot in anybody's CTF—there's no losing points
      while the organizers struggle to get things back up.
