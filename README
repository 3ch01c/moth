Dirtbags King Of The Hill Server
=====================

This is a set of thingies to run our KOTH-style contest.
Contests we've run in the past have been called
"Tracer FIRE" and "Project 2".

It serves up puzzles in a manner similar to Jeopardy.
It also track scores,
and comes with a JavaScript-based scoreboard to display team rankings.


How Everything Works
----------------------------

I should fill this in, but I don't feel like anybody would read it.
Send an email to <neale@woozle.org> asking me how it works,
and I'll write this part up and email it back to you :)


How to set it up
--------------------

It's made to be virtualized,
so you can run multiple contests at once if you want.
If you were to want to run it out of `/opt/koth`,
do the following:

	$ mkdir -p /opt/koth/mycontest
	$ ./install /opt/koth/mycontest
	$ cp kothd /opt/koth
	
Yay, you've got it set up.


Installing Puzzle Categories
------------------------------------

Puzzle categories are distributed in a different way than the server.
After setting up (see above), just run

	$ /opt/koth/mycontest/bin/install-category /path/to/my/category
	

Running It
-------------

Get your web server to serve up files from
`/opt/koth/mycontest/www`.

Then run `/opt/koth/kothd`.


Permissions
----------------

It's up to you not to be a bonehead about permissions.

Install sets it so the web user on your system can write to the files it needs to,
but if you're using Apache,
it plays games with user IDs when running CGI.
You're going to have to figure out how to configure your preferred web server.
