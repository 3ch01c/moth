Dirtbags King Of The Hill Server
=====================

This is a set of thingies to run our KOTH-style contest.
Contests we've run in the past have been called
"Tracer FIRE" and "Project 2".

It serves up puzzles in a manner similar to Jeopardy.
It also track scores,
and comes with a JavaScript-based scoreboard to display team rankings.


How Everything Works
----------------------------

I should fill this in, but I don't feel like anybody would read it.
Send an email to <neale@woozle.org> asking me how it works,
and I'll write this part up and email it back to you :)


How to set it up
--------------------

It's made to be virtualized,
so you can run multiple contests at once if you want.
If you were to want to run it out of `/opt/koth`,
do the following:

	$ mkdir -p /opt/hack/mycontest
	$ ./install /opt/hack/mycontest
	$ cp kothd /opt/hack
	
Yay, you've got it set up.


Installing Puzzle Categories
------------------------------------

Puzzle categories are distributed in a different way than the server.
If you have one,
just run

	$ /opt/koth/hack/bin/install-category /path/to/my/category
	

Running It
-------------

Get your web server to serve up files from
`/opt/koth/hack/www`.

Then run `/opt/koth/kothd`.

It's up to you not to be a bonehead about permissions.
